Simple Framework for Java development.

This is a set of classes and helper files that I used for many, many years
since I started developing applications for J2ME platforms. At that time this
was a single JAR file imported in all my applications. Time passed and Android
came up. Now we cannot have all files in a single JAR becouse some files has
the same names but different implementations. So we need to split it up in
several JAR files that can be imported separated and used together.

This is a working in progress library. It is not finished and, I think, it
will never be. Be prepared to some unsolved bugs and lack of some features
since I spend some time on it only in my spair hours.

If you find some bug, please, let me know. My e-mail is:
