/**
 * \defgroup sf_lang The Lang Package
 * This package has the most basic classes of this library.
 * It has some constant declarations only classes like \c ERROR and \c ENC and
 * some static helper classes like \c arrays and \c strings. When Java 1.5
 * came through it brought some utility classes like \c Arrays with static
 * methods only. But mine was already done and in production so it is still
 * here and still in use.
 *
 * The classes here are all independent of the JVM implementation. They are
 * pure Java classes and will run in PC, Android or any other implementation
 * in the same way (except J2ME).
